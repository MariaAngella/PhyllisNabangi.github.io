Nicholas from Africa is talking gave us an overview of how Africa is talking can provide a way through an API for people and companies across about 7 markets on the African continent to connect via SMS messages.  

Africa is talking offers bulk SMS, short codes and premium SMS, USSD, MMS and customized mobile messaging solutions for individuals, businesses and developers. The API allows users to integrate the service to build SMS based apps. With the API developers can connect a short code, use an alphanumeric sender id and send SMS messages across Kenya. Users need to register to access documentation.

The audience had a chance to ask the brilliant panel some of their questions. The questions ranged from all aspects  technical and enterpreneurial.   


There was also concern on whether firebase supports cross platform applications. The panel said yes while pointing out that it ca not be used for USSD applications.  


One question that stood out was on how developers can effectively make money from the apps they develop. The answers provided gave more eamphasis on ensuring you involve the user in development and also ensuring one is resolving a problem. 

All panelists finally advised on major points to consider while running and scaling startups. Alot of advise pointed out the fact that startups need to ensure that they are solving a problem , can convince an investor and ensure that they can convice 10 people who love them before they launch.Starups were also advised to launch as early as possible to get feedback and iterate whenever they are getting it wrong.
